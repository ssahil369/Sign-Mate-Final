        <h1>Sign-Mate</h1>
	<h1>Welcome to our Sign-Mate App!</h1>
	<p>This app is built using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) letters from A to Z. Our model was trained using Google Teachable Machine. 🤖🧠💻</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>To run our Sign Detection App, you will need the following software packages installed on your computer:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Python 🐍</li>
		<li>TensorFlow 🤖</li>
		<li>OpenCV 📷</li>
		<li>MediaPipe 🎥</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
		<li>Install the required software packages using pip or conda.</li>
		<li>Run the app.py file to launch the app. 🚀</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>Once the app is launched, you can use your webcam to capture an image of your hand. The app will then analyze the image and detect the ASL letter that your hand is forming. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦📹👨‍💻</p>
	<h2>Known Issues</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The app may have difficulty detecting letters in low light conditions or when there is poor contrast between your hand and the background. 🌑🌞🎥</li>
		<li>The app may have difficulty detecting letters if your hand is not positioned correctly or if your fingers are not clearly visible. 👋🏼🤚🏼</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We would like to thank GDSC and Google Solutions Challenge for creating Competitive Enviroment.</li>
		<li>We also thank Google for providing the Teachable Machine platform and the TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe communities for their excellent software packages. 🙏🏼👏🏼👨‍💻</li>
